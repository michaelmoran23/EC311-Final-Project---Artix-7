**Overview of Project:**
Our Multi-function clock includes a fully functional 24-hour alarm clock and a stopwatch. The alarm clock's time can be manually entered, and it also includes a pre-set minigame to help encourage the user to get up when the alarm goes off. The stopwatch is a standard timing device that can be started, stopped, and reset.

**How to run project:**
The switches on the FPGA board can be used to alter the number of hours, number of minutes, and number of seconds, which can be used to set the alarm clock or reset the stopwatch.
